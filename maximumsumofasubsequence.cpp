/*
Find the maximum sum of a subsequence with no adjacent elements
Given an integer array, find the maximum sum of 
subsequence where the subsequence contains no element at adjacent positions.
Please note that the problem specifically targets subsequences that need not be contiguous, 
i.e., subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
For example,
Input:  { 1, 2, 9, 4, 5, 0, 4, 11, 6 }
Output: The maximum sum is 26
The maximum sum is formed by subsequence { 1, 9, 5, 11 }
